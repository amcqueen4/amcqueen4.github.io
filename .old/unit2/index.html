            <h1>Analysis of Mathematical Techniques&trade;</h1>
            Written by Andrew McQueen <i>(2022amcqueen&#64;vg302.org)</i>

            <h2>Math? Whats that?</h2>
            <blockquote>"<b>Mathematics</b>: the science of structure, order, and relation that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring, and describing the shapes of objects."</blockquote>
            To put it in other words, mathematics is the most important field of study. All fields of study implement core reasoning and study from mathematics. 
            <h2>Why would anyone need it? </h2>
            <p>
                <i>Every</i> modern problem requires mathematics to be described and solved. Consider a basic situation such as the profit margin from a business: If a company sells a doodad for five dollars, but it costs an initial twenty dollars to start operation, how would you represent this situation? 
                <br>
                <br>
                The answer is in terms of a linear equation:  
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                However, more complex problems often require much more complex mathematics. Consider how you might derive an approximation for the square root of a number with only pencil and paper, then reflect on the reading for Newton's Method.

            <h2>Examples of Math In Use Today?</h2>
            There are many complex problems that can require complex solutions&ndash;or approximations to be reasoned. Consider the following: 
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    Calculus
                    <ul type = "disc">
                        <li>Area under curves (ex. Bell Curve for Percentile).</li>
                        <li>Projectile trajectory mapping.</li>
                        <li>Fluid Dynamics</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Linear Algebra
                    <ul type = "disc">
                        <li>Hitbox detection.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
